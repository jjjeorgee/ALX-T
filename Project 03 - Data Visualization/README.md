## Dataset

This Dataset includes information about individual rides made in a bike-sharing system covering the San Francisco Bay area. The data collected spans the period of february to march 2019. The information provided by the dataset focuses on user related variables such as gender and user type, station related variables such as station name and id, and time related variables such when the bike rides begin and end.

The structure of the dataset was initially 16 columns and 183,412 rows. However, after cleaning the data, we were left with 22 columns and 174,952 columns.



## Summary of Findings

The dataset contained a lot of information, but we could extract so much. The information extracted may be divided into 3 distinct categories i.e information about the users, information about ride duration and frequency and information about the different stations.

The users consist mainly of subscribers, who make up 90.53% of all users, while customers make up the remaining  9.47%. Of these users, 74.59% of then identify as male, 23.32% as female, and the remaining 2.08% as other. 

Although making up the smallest population of the 3 availables genders, Others have the highest average trip duration, followed by the females, and then the males. And just like the males, subscribers also seem to take shorter trips on average than the customers. Most rides start and end at 8am and 5pm, and there's generally more rides being taken during the weekdays than on the weekends.

Of all the available stations, the one at Market Street at 10th Street seems to be the most visited, with the least visited being the station at 16th street Depot.
